Goals of Study Group
--------------------
* The agenda itself is the idea of what the study core idea is... basically make sure everyone is participating in a learning/teaching activity and really, really, really make sure everyone feels like they can and should participate
* Bring together the brilliant minds of the tech industry within Ann Arbor, to be accessible to those who want to learn from them

Prior to the study group meeting
--------------------------------
* Mention food in Meetup online before the Meetup, so people know there is food available (a lot of people did not eat last time around)
* send a reminder email in meetup a few days before the actual meetup
* Use twitter to remind people of the meetup before the meetup
* Get a 'regular' to run a group project, if there is one that is happening (those leading the study group need to focus on the study group)

At the study group meeting
--------------------------
Right before the meeting:
* Maybe have a whiteboard ready (ask Dave before the meeting starts)
* Might also be useful to touch base with Dave (or whoever is the Pillar liaison) briefly prior to the meeting, in case he has something he needs to talk about before members arrive
* Watch for members who are new to study group and seem a little lost, and catch them right when they walk in, make them feel welcome and see if you can help them figure out what they might want to learn
* Bug our 'regulars' before the study group and ask what topics they may talk about

Beginning of the meeting:
* Introduce the study group (and yourself!)
* Introduce Dave and Pillar
* Let people know that there is food available (if Dave doesn't mention it)
* Mention any topics our 'regulars' will be talking about, and where
* Mention our projects (group project, exercism.io, etc.)
* Mention the study group chat room in gitter.im

During the meeting:
* You should be "working the room", making members feel welcome and helping to connect them with people that can help
	* Try to get experienced devs mingling more with those with less experience
	* Be the liaison/facilitator, not the teacher (Delegate helping newer devs to other experienced devs)
	* Make sure the people that seem shy and new get more of the attention, and get the attention first
	* The main goal is to remove the intimidation
* Remind people there is food again about half way through (this seemed to help get people up and moving, getting a break, and got a little more of the food eaten)

End of the meeting:
* Remind people when we are almost out of time, so they can finish up what they are doing and be ready to leave at 8
* Help Pillar keep things clean by helping clean up at the end of the study group

After (and in between) study group meetings
-------------------------------------------
* Continue trying to help the members in between meetings, usually through gitter.im or emails
* Make sure to schedule the next study group, if you haven't already
