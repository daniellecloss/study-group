Ideas for future study groups meetings
--------------------------------------
* Live coding walk throughÂ 
* Randoori style pair programming
* Dot voting for topics
* Present list of topic ideas?
* Have giveaways for involved participants?
* How do we continue to making people feel welcome and give them help and resources, during and in between meetings?
* The new group project Miguel mentioned at the last study group (He said that Brian and he were cooking up something new. (I am wanting more details about this!  I think it's a good idea)
* Maybe we should be thanking everyone for coming on the meetup website, like a follow up email/announcement? Or in gitter.im?
